# CHIP-8-interpreter

Just a hobby project to learn basics of emulation.
It should be able to run chip-8 ROM's on pc when completed and debugged.
Warning: I'm still working on bug fixes

### Installation
* `git clone --recursive https://github.com/berkaykarlik/CHIP-8-interpreter.git`
* Optional but recommended: `python -m venv venv`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running

* Run this command from the root (top level) of this repo:
`python main.py path_to_ROM_file`

* if you clonned the repo recursively as described in installation steps roms are under: `roms\chip8Archive\roms`
