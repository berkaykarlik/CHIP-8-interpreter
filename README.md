![INVADERS](../assets/invader.png?raw=true =250x250 "available on roms and david winters site")
![PETDOG](../assets/petdog.png?raw=true =250x250 "available on chip8archive")

Just a hobby project to learn basics of emulation.
It should be able to run chip-8 ROM's on pc when completed and debugged.
Warning: I'm still working on bug fixes, see issues for known bugs.

### Installation
* `git clone --recursive https://github.com/berkaykarlik/CHIP-8-interpreter.git`
* Optional but recommended: `python -m venv venv`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running

* Run this command from the root (top level) of this repo:
`python main.py path_to_ROM_file`

* if you clonned the repo recursively, as described in installation steps, roms are under: `roms\chip8Archive\roms`

### Keys
Every game has different set of controls, I mapped the 16 buttons to the keys in table below.
Relative order of keys is preserved.
|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| q | w | e | r |
| a | s | d | f |
| z | x | c | v |

### Roms

I have included some roms I found as freeware from David Winter's site and chip8Archive repository.
See roms/README for links. I made no modifications and have no claims on them.
